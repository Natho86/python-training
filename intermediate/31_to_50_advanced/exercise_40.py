# Exercise 40: Working with datetime Module
# Difficulty: Intermediate-
# Concepts: datetime module, Date manipulation, Time calculations

"""
PROBLEM:
Create a program that uses the datetime module to:
1. Display the current date and time
2. Calculate someone's age given their birth date
3. Calculate how many days until a specific date (like a birthday)
4. Format dates in different styles

EXAMPLE:
Input: Birth date: 1990-05-15
Output:
- Current date: 2024-11-27
- Age: 34 years old
- Next birthday: 2025-05-15
- Days until birthday: 169 days

HINTS:
1. Import datetime: from datetime import datetime, timedelta
2. Get current date: datetime.now()
3. Create specific date: datetime(year, month, day)
4. Date difference: date1 - date2 returns a timedelta object

EXTENSION:
Create a function that calculates the difference between two dates and returns
it in a human-readable format (X years, Y months, Z days). Also add a function
to check if a given year is a leap year.
