# Exercise 31: Flexible Sum Function with *args
# Difficulty: Intermediate-
# Concepts: *args, Variable arguments, Functions

"""
PROBLEM:
Create a function called flexible_sum() that can accept any number of numeric arguments
and returns their sum. The function should work with 1, 2, 5, or even 100 arguments.

EXAMPLE:
Input: flexible_sum(1, 2, 3)
Output: 6

Input: flexible_sum(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
Output: 150

Input: flexible_sum(5)
Output: 5

HINTS:
1. Use *args in the function parameter to accept any number of arguments
2. *args collects all arguments into a tuple
3. You can iterate through args or use the built-in sum() function

EXTENSION:
Create a flexible_operation() function that takes an operation ('+', '*', 'min', 'max')
as the first argument, followed by any number of numbers, and performs that operation.
