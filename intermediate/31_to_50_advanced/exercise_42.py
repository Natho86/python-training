# Exercise 42: Math Module and Calculations
# Difficulty: Intermediate-
# Concepts: math module, Mathematical functions, Constants

"""
PROBLEM:
Create a program using the math module that:
1. Calculates the area and circumference of a circle given radius
2. Finds the distance between two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2)
3. Rounds numbers using different methods (floor, ceil, round)
4. Calculates powers, square roots, and logarithms

EXAMPLE:
Circle with radius 5:
- Area: 78.54
- Circumference: 31.42

Distance between (0,0) and (3,4): 5.0

Number 4.7:
- Floor: 4
- Ceil: 5
- Round: 5

HINTS:
1. math.pi gives you the value of π
2. math.sqrt(x) calculates square root
3. math.floor(x) rounds down, math.ceil(x) rounds up
4. Use Pythagorean theorem for distance: sqrt((x2-x1)² + (y2-y1)²)

EXTENSION:
Create functions to calculate the volume of common 3D shapes (sphere, cylinder, cone)
and convert between degrees and radians for trigonometric functions.
