# Exercise 23: List Comprehensions Basics
# Difficulty: Beginner+
# Concepts: List comprehensions, Filtering, Transformations

"""
PROBLEM:
Create various list comprehensions to demonstrate their power:
1. Create a list of squares from 1 to 10
2. Filter even numbers from a list
3. Convert a list of strings to uppercase
4. Create a list of tuples with numbers and their squares

EXAMPLE:
Input: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

Output:
Squares: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
Even numbers: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Doubled evens: [4, 8, 12, 16, 20]

HINTS:
1. Basic syntax: [expression for item in iterable]
2. With condition: [expression for item in iterable if condition]
3. Can transform and filter in one line
4. More readable than equivalent for loops for simple operations

EXTENSION:
Create nested list comprehensions to work with 2D data.
Use comprehensions with multiple conditions.
Compare performance of list comprehension vs traditional loops.
