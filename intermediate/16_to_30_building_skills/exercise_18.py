# Exercise 18: Student Grade Manager
# Difficulty: Beginner+
# Concepts: Dictionaries, Nested structures, Functions, Calculations

"""
PROBLEM:
Create a student grade management system that stores student names and their grades
in different subjects. Calculate the average grade for each student and find the
student with the highest average.

EXAMPLE:
Input: students = {
    'Alice': {'Math': 85, 'Science': 92, 'English': 78},
    'Bob': {'Math': 90, 'Science': 88, 'English': 95},
    'Charlie': {'Math': 78, 'Science': 85, 'English': 80}
}

Output:
Alice's average: 85.0
Bob's average: 91.0
Charlie's average: 81.0
Top student: Bob with average 91.0

HINTS:
1. Use nested dictionaries to store student data
2. Use sum() and len() to calculate averages
3. Track the highest average while iterating through students

EXTENSION:
Add functionality to:
- Add new students or update grades
- Find the highest and lowest grade across all subjects
- Generate a report card for each student with letter grades (A, B, C, etc.)
