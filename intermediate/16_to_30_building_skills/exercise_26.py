# Exercise 26: Basic Error Handling
# Difficulty: Intermediate-
# Concepts: try/except blocks, Exception types, Error handling

"""
PROBLEM:
Create a program that demonstrates error handling:
1. Handle division by zero
2. Handle invalid input (ValueError)
3. Handle file not found errors
4. Use multiple except blocks for different error types
5. Use finally block for cleanup

EXAMPLE:
Input: "10 / 0"
Output: "Error: Cannot divide by zero"

Input: "abc / 5"
Output: "Error: Invalid number format"

Input: Read "nonexistent.txt"
Output: "Error: File not found"

HINTS:
1. Use try/except to catch and handle errors
2. Common exceptions: ValueError, ZeroDivisionError, FileNotFoundError
3. Multiple except blocks can handle different error types
4. finally block always executes (useful for cleanup)
5. Use else block for code that runs when no error occurs

EXTENSION:
Create a calculator that handles all input errors gracefully.
Build a file reader that tries multiple file locations.
Implement custom exception messages for better user feedback.
