# Exercise 16: Word Frequency Counter
# Difficulty: Beginner+
# Concepts: Dictionaries, String methods, Loops

"""
PROBLEM:
Create a program that counts the frequency of each word in a given text.
Display the results sorted by frequency (most common first).

EXAMPLE:
Input: "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog the fox"
Output:
the: 2
fox: 2
quick: 1
brown: 1
jumps: 1
over: 1
lazy: 1
dog: 1

HINTS:
1. Split the text into words using .split()
2. Use a dictionary to store word counts
3. Use .get() method or check if key exists before incrementing
4. Sort the dictionary by values in descending order

EXTENSION:
Add functionality to ignore common words (the, a, an, etc.) and handle punctuation.
Create a function to find the N most common words.
