# Exercise 20: Set Operations
# Difficulty: Beginner+
# Concepts: Sets, Set operations, Unique elements

"""
PROBLEM:
Create a program that demonstrates various set operations:
1. Remove duplicates from a list using sets
2. Find common elements between two lists (intersection)
3. Find unique elements in each list (symmetric difference)
4. Combine two lists without duplicates (union)

EXAMPLE:
Input: list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 2]
       list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 5, 6]

Output:
Common elements: {4, 5}
Only in list1: {1, 2, 3}
Only in list2: {6, 7, 8}
All unique elements: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

HINTS:
1. Convert lists to sets using set()
2. Use & for intersection, | for union, - for difference
3. Use .intersection(), .union(), .difference() methods
4. Symmetric difference: elements in either set, but not both

EXTENSION:
Create a program that finds students enrolled in multiple courses using sets.
Implement a function to check if one set is a subset/superset of another.
