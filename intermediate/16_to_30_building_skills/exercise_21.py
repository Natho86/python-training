# Exercise 21: String Formatting Master
# Difficulty: Beginner+
# Concepts: String formatting, f-strings, .format() method

"""
PROBLEM:
Create a program that demonstrates various string formatting techniques:
1. Use f-strings to format variables into strings
2. Format numbers with specific decimal places
3. Align text (left, right, center)
4. Format dates and create formatted reports

EXAMPLE:
Input: name="Alice", age=25, balance=1234.567
Output:
Name: Alice
Age: 25
Balance: $1,234.57

Formatted table:
Name        Age    Balance
Alice        25   $1234.57

HINTS:
1. f-strings use f"text {variable}" syntax
2. Format specifiers: {value:.2f} for 2 decimal places
3. Alignment: {value:<10} (left), {value:>10} (right), {value:^10} (center)
4. Thousands separator: {value:,}

EXTENSION:
Create a receipt generator that formats items, quantities, prices, and totals.
Format large numbers with thousands separators and currency symbols.
