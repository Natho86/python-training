# Exercise 22: String Methods Explorer
# Difficulty: Beginner+
# Concepts: String methods, String manipulation, Text processing

"""
PROBLEM:
Create a program that demonstrates various string methods:
1. Case conversion (upper, lower, title, capitalize)
2. String testing (isalpha, isdigit, isalnum, startswith, endswith)
3. String searching and replacing (find, replace, count)
4. String trimming and splitting (strip, split, join)

EXAMPLE:
Input: text = "  Hello, World!  "
Output:
Stripped: "Hello, World!"
Uppercase: "HELLO, WORLD!"
Word count: 2
Contains 'World': True

HINTS:
1. Most string methods return a new string (strings are immutable)
2. Use .strip() to remove whitespace from both ends
3. .split() breaks a string into a list, .join() combines a list into a string
4. String methods like .startswith() and .endswith() are useful for validation

EXTENSION:
Create a text analyzer that counts words, sentences, and average word length.
Build a simple text formatter that normalizes whitespace and capitalizes sentences.
