# Exercise 8: Palindrome Checker
# Difficulty: Beginner
# Concepts: Strings, String slicing, Comparison operators, String methods

"""
PROBLEM:
Write a program that checks if a word or phrase is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
Ignore spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

EXAMPLE:
Input: "racecar"
Output: "racecar" is a palindrome!

Input: "A man a plan a canal Panama"
Output: "A man a plan a canal Panama" is a palindrome!

Input: "hello"
Output: "hello" is not a palindrome.

HINTS:
1. Convert the string to lowercase using .lower()
2. Remove spaces and punctuation (keep only letters)
3. Compare the string with its reverse (use slicing [::-1])

EXTENSION:
Find the longest palindromic substring in a given string.
