# Exercise 15: Prime Number Checker
# Difficulty: Beginner
# Concepts: Functions, Loops, Conditional logic, Mathematical operations

"""
PROBLEM:
Write a program that determines if a number is prime.
A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Then, create a function that finds all prime numbers up to a given limit.

EXAMPLE:
Input: 17
Output: 17 is prime

Input: 20
Output: 20 is not prime

Find primes up to 30:
Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]

HINTS:
1. Numbers less than 2 are not prime
2. Check if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to sqrt(n)
3. If you find any divisor, the number is not prime

EXTENSION:
Implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for finding primes more efficiently.
Also calculate and display the prime number density (percentage of primes) up to a given number.
