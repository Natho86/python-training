# Exercise 3: Simple Calculator
# Difficulty: Beginner
# Concepts: Arithmetic operators, Control flow (if/elif/else), Functions

"""
PROBLEM:
Create a simple calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
on two numbers based on user choice.

EXAMPLE:
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Choose operation (+, -, *, /): *
Result: 10 * 5 = 50

HINTS:
1. Get two numbers and an operation symbol from the user
2. Use if/elif/else to determine which operation to perform
3. Handle division by zero as a special case

EXTENSION:
Add support for more operations: exponentiation (**), modulo (%), and integer division (//).
