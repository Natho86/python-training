# Exercise 4: FizzBuzz
# Difficulty: Beginner
# Concepts: Loops (for loop with range), Control flow, Modulo operator, Logical operators

"""
PROBLEM:
Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100, but:
- For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number
- For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number
- For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"

EXAMPLE:
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
...

HINTS:
1. Use a for loop with range(1, 101) to iterate from 1 to 100
2. Check for divisibility using the modulo operator (%)
3. Check the FizzBuzz condition first (multiples of both 3 and 5)

EXTENSION:
Modify the program to accept custom numbers instead of 3 and 5, and a custom range.
