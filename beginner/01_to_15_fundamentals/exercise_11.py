# Exercise 11: Grade Calculator
# Difficulty: Beginner
# Concepts: Lists, Functions, Arithmetic operations, Control flow

"""
PROBLEM:
Create a grade calculator that:
1. Takes a list of test scores (0-100)
2. Calculates the average score
3. Determines the letter grade based on the average:
   - A: 90-100
   - B: 80-89
   - C: 70-79
   - D: 60-69
   - F: Below 60
4. Shows the highest and lowest scores

EXAMPLE:
Scores: [85, 92, 78, 90, 88]
Average: 86.6
Letter Grade: B
Highest Score: 92
Lowest Score: 78

HINTS:
1. Calculate average using sum() and len()
2. Use if/elif/else to determine the letter grade
3. Use max() and min() functions for highest and lowest

EXTENSION:
Add weighted grades (tests 40%, homework 30%, final exam 30%) and calculate GPA on a 4.0 scale.
