# Exercise 7: List Sum and Average
# Difficulty: Beginner
# Concepts: Lists, For loops, Arithmetic operations, Functions

"""
PROBLEM:
Write a program that calculates the sum and average of numbers in a list.

EXAMPLE:
Input list: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
Output:
Sum: 150
Average: 30.0

HINTS:
1. Initialize a sum variable to 0
2. Loop through the list and add each number to the sum
3. Calculate average by dividing sum by the number of elements (use len())

EXTENSION:
Extend the program to also calculate the median (middle value when sorted) and mode (most frequent value).
