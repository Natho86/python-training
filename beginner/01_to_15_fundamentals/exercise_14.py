# Exercise 14: List Reverser
# Difficulty: Beginner
# Concepts: Lists, List slicing, Loops, Functions

"""
PROBLEM:
Write a program that reverses a list without using the built-in reverse() method or [::-1] slicing.
Implement it by manually swapping elements.

EXAMPLE:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Input: ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
Output: ["cherry", "banana", "apple"]

HINTS:
1. Use two pointers: one at the start, one at the end
2. Swap elements at these positions
3. Move pointers toward the center
4. Stop when pointers meet in the middle

EXTENSION:
Reverse only a portion of the list (e.g., reverse elements from index 2 to 5).
Also, reverse the words in a sentence while keeping word order.
