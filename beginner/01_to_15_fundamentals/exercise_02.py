# Exercise 2: Even or Odd Checker
# Difficulty: Beginner
# Concepts: Control flow (if/else), Modulo operator, Comparison operators

"""
PROBLEM:
Create a program that determines whether a number is even or odd.

EXAMPLE:
Input: 7
Output: 7 is odd

Input: 12
Output: 12 is even

HINTS:
1. The modulo operator (%) gives the remainder of division
2. Even numbers have no remainder when divided by 2
3. Use an if/else statement to check the condition

EXTENSION:
Extend the program to check multiple numbers from a list and count how many are even vs odd.
