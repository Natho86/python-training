# Exercise 12: Vowel Counter
# Difficulty: Beginner
# Concepts: Strings, For loops, Conditional logic, String methods

"""
PROBLEM:
Write a program that counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a string.
Count both uppercase and lowercase vowels.

EXAMPLE:
Input: "Hello World"
Output: Number of vowels: 3

Input: "Python Programming"
Output: Number of vowels: 4

HINTS:
1. Convert the string to lowercase for easier comparison
2. Create a string or list of vowels to check against
3. Loop through each character and check if it's a vowel

EXTENSION:
Count each vowel separately and show which vowel appears most frequently.
Also count consonants and calculate the vowel-to-consonant ratio.
