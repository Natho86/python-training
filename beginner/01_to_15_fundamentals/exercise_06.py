# Exercise 6: List Maximum Finder
# Difficulty: Beginner
# Concepts: Lists, For loops, Variables, Comparison operators

"""
PROBLEM:
Write a program that finds the maximum value in a list of numbers without using the built-in max() function.

EXAMPLE:
Input list: [3, 7, 2, 9, 1, 5]
Output: The maximum value is: 9

Input list: [-5, -2, -10, -1]
Output: The maximum value is: -1

HINTS:
1. Initialize a variable to hold the maximum value (start with the first element)
2. Loop through each element in the list
3. Compare each element to the current maximum and update if larger

EXTENSION:
Extend the program to also find the minimum value and the position (index) of both max and min values.
