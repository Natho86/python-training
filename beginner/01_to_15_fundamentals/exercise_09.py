# Exercise 9: Password Validator
# Difficulty: Beginner
# Concepts: Strings, String methods, Control flow, Logical operators

"""
PROBLEM:
Create a password validator that checks if a password meets these requirements:
- At least 8 characters long
- Contains at least one uppercase letter
- Contains at least one lowercase letter
- Contains at least one digit

EXAMPLE:
Input: "Pass123"
Output: Invalid - Password must be at least 8 characters long

Input: "password123"
Output: Invalid - Password must contain at least one uppercase letter

Input: "Password123"
Output: Valid password!

HINTS:
1. Use len() to check password length
2. Use string methods: .isupper(), .islower(), .isdigit()
3. Loop through each character to check for requirements

EXTENSION:
Add more requirements: special characters (!@#$%), no repeated characters more than twice in a row,
and provide specific feedback for each failed requirement.
