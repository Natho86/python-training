PROBLEM:
Create a simple shopping list manager that allows users to:
1. Add items to the list
2. Remove items from the list
3. View all items
4. Clear the entire list
5. Exit the program

EXAMPLE:
Shopping List Manager
1. Add item
2. Remove item
3. View list
4. Clear list
5. Exit
Enter choice: 1
Enter item to add: Apples
Added 'Apples' to the list.

Enter choice: 3
Shopping List:
- Apples

HINTS:
1. Use a while loop for the menu system
2. Use list methods: append() to add, remove() to delete
3. Use a for loop to display all items

EXTENSION:
Add features to mark items as purchased (without removing them), save the list to a file,
and load the list from a file.
