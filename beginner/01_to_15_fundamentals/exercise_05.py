# Exercise 5: Number Guessing Game
# Difficulty: Beginner
# Concepts: While loops, Random numbers, Control flow, Comparison operators

"""
PROBLEM:
Create a number guessing game where:
1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100
2. The user tries to guess the number
3. After each guess, the program tells the user if their guess is too high, too low, or correct
4. The game continues until the user guesses correctly
5. Display how many attempts it took

EXAMPLE:
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100...
Enter your guess: 50
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 75
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 60
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 67
Correct! You guessed it in 4 attempts!

HINTS:
1. Import the random module and use random.randint(1, 100)
2. Use a while loop that continues until the guess is correct
3. Keep track of the number of attempts with a counter variable

EXTENSION:
Add difficulty levels (Easy: 1-50, Medium: 1-100, Hard: 1-500) and give hints when the user is within 5 of the answer.
